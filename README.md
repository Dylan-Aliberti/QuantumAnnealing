# QuantumAnnealing
This is a small project for getting experience with quantum annealing.
We factorise a number R into P*Q, where R is assumed to be the product of two prime numbers. This could for example be used to break RSA encryption.

The first approach is by modelling binary multiplication in terms of logical gates, which is taken by D'Wave's example:

The second approach is based on work from Jiang et al, which reduces the number of variables:

Due to the limited time spent on this project, do not consider it finished nor stable.
